                <p>Gender inequality refers to the unequal treatment or perception of individuals based on their gender. This issue deeply impacts various aspects of life, from psychological well-being to economic stability and family dynamics. Prolonged exposure to gender bias can lead to stress, anxiety, and diminished self-esteem as individuals internalize feelings of inadequacy (Medical News Today, 2023). Economically, inequality is evident in wage gaps and limited career advancement opportunities, particularly for women, which affects financial independence and perpetuates cycles of poverty (SAGG Foundation, 2022).</p>
                <p>However, it is important to acknowledge that men, too, face challenges due to gender inequality. Social expectations may restrict emotional expression or push men into traditional roles that limit their personal and professional growth. In education and career development, both men and women encounter barriers in fields where bias is prevalent, limiting access to skills and opportunities for advancement.</p>
                <p>Additionally, societal expectations around gender roles often place caregiving and household responsibilities disproportionately on one gender, influencing personal relationships and constraining individual growth. Raising awareness of these impacts is essential for fostering policies that promote equality across all areas of life, benefiting both men and women.</p>
